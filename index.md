# Brittany's Website 

My first website using Markdown and GitHub Pages. I chose the theme Hacker because that is what coding makes me feel like I'm doing.

## Important Links

Here's a clickable link: [My GitHub profile](https://github.com/Bdowdle4)

## Favorite Images

Images look like links except with an exclamation directly in front
