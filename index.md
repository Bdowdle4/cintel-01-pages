# Brittany's Website 

My first website using Markdown and GitHub Pages. I chose the theme Hacker because that is what coding makes me feel like I'm doing.

## Reminders

My goal is to implement these items before the next project:

- Get more creative in your customizations

- Proofread all submissions before posting to your discussions

- Have fun doing it
